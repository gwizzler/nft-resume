### NFT system

In January I built this NFT system to learn about the managment of hydroponic systems. My goal was not perfection but to navigate the obstacles of designing, building and managing an NFT system. There are many things I would change about this system if I was building it again. I will likely turn it off for winter soon.

### Nutrients / HydroBuddy

The most intruiging aspect of plant care and biology to me are the nutrient profiles required during certain stages of growth.

I did not want to purchase a static fertilizer product and make do with suboptimal nutrient profiles. One of my early goals in this project was to understand the base elements of a hydroponic nutrient soloution/product and be able to replicate it on demand with limited resources. I also wanted to be confident that the soloutions were functional and proven.

Early on in my journey I discovered HydroBuddy and that tool allowed me to understand far better the base macro/micronutrients and their role in plant health. I found that most plants had ebooks published that were very easy to find online and those books contained information and nutrient profiles for specific plants.
