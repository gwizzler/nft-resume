### NFT system

In January I built this NFT system to learn about the managment of hydroponic systems. My goal was not perfection but to navigate the obstacles of designing, building and managing an NFT system. There are many things I would change about this system if I was building it again. I will likely turn it off for winter soon.

### Nutrients / HydroBuddy

The most intruiging aspect of plant care and biology to me are the nutrient profiles required during certain stages of growth.

I did not want to purchase a static fertilizer product and make do with suboptimal nutrient profiles. One of my early goals in this project was to understand the base elements of a hydroponic nutrient soloution/product and be able to replicate it on demand with limited resources. I also wanted to be confident that the soloutions were functional and proven. I was also interested in reverse engineering off the shelf products to better understand what they are doing and why.

Early on in my journey I discovered HydroBuddy and that tool allowed me to understand far better the base macro/micronutrients and their role in plant health. I found that most plants had ebooks published that were very easy to find online and those books contained information and nutrient profiles for specific plants.

Begin growing plants and watch closely for any problems then troubleshoot as required.

I make my nutrients with MKP, Magnesium Sulphate, Calcium nirate and Potassium nitrate. I use cheap manutec micronutrients that aren't very ph stable at the moment but I'm trying to source more PH stable micronutrients.

## Problems, Soloutions and Concerns
#### Netcups
Netcups don't reach the bottom, meaning the system was best suiting being angled into a deep flow technique system. Other cups would fix this.

#### Medium
I use coco coir and have some problems with it. Using vermiculite and some basic filters would solve this.

#### Temperature

In the heat of the summer sun, the plants can wilt. They also slow down in winter. I hoped to build a greenhouse or hoophouse around it but didn't see it as quite worthwhile considering the price.

#### Water return

I used the same cheap irrigation hose and gratuitous amounts of silicone sealants to make it watertight. I should have rather left it more open and not done ends. I should have a single pvc return pipe instead of multiple disperate hoses.

#### Nutrient soloution

I am using a nutrient profile from [this ebook](https://www.purdue.edu/hla/sites/master-gardener/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/Guide-To-Home-Hydroponics-For-Leafy-Greens-Ronzoni-and-Mattson-2020.pdf). The Modified Sonneveld solution. It's suitable for lettuce but not kale, for example. They are struggling and I would need to have individual resovoirs/channels in order to fix it.

#### PH problems

At a certain point early in my managment of the system I used too much phosphoric acid/PH down and the ph went very low for a day. I put the ph back in range but the plants were not happy as I believe micronutrients had percipitated out. I managed the system for a number of days watching the plants go bad before I changed the resovoir and they went back to normal. Since then I've been very careful to keep ph in reasonable ranges, not change it too much at a time and to always check before/after an addition and to make note of it where appropriate. This is also what woke me up to how poor my micronutrients were and I've begun sourcing each element.

#### Seed starting

I'm currently seed starting at the bottom of a small indoor grow tent, in coco coir that is inside netcups. My success rate indoors with controlled enviromentals is significantly higher than outdoors with just the domes on. 

# Plant propagation experience

I have grown tomatoes and rooted cuttings to multiply them rather than starting from seed. I don't find it particularly difficult to understand tasks and I can keep the enviromentals of plants within appropriate parameters if given the instruction and resources required to do so.
